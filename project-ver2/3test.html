        <h1>Special Tricks of PUBG Mobile</h1>
        <p>CHOOSE THE RIGHT PLACE TO JUMP!</p>
        <p>New players could try to choose a smaller town or cities far away from the airline when parachuting.&nbsp;Wait until you are familiar with the rules of the game and have a higher level, then choose the big cities and cities below the airlines.&nbsp;Otherwise,   your game experience will "always be in the helicopter".</p>

      <p>BE BRAVE WHEN YOU ARE INDOOR!</p>
        <p>When you arrive in the ground, take a gun first, then a helmet and armor. 
          When two people try to rob a gun, you can also take his bullet away. 
          Don't panic if someone drives to you while you're searching for equipment. You can hide on the second floor. When he comes in and searching the first floor, you will jump out and drive away his car or squat near his car to kill him. If he goes directly to the second floor, you have the priority of shooting and a greater chance of survival if you hide behind an object.</p>

        <p>BE CAUTIOUS WHEN YOU ARE OUTDOOR!</p>
        <p>If you encounter an enemy outside a building, first you need to consider whether you have a cover. Only when you have a cover can you attack the enemy. Don't&nbsp;prostrate in a field or haystack near  tall buildings because people upstairs can easily see you with a scope.   When searching for obsolete players' boxes, you need to be quick and keep your body moving. Find the right time to use bombs and smokes at the final circle.</p>

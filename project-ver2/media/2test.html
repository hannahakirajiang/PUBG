        <h1>PUBG Mobile vs PUBG PC</h1>
        <p>1. First of all, PUBG Mobile and PC versions of the graphics quality and detail processing is different. The PC version has a high graphics quality and requires a high computer configuration to run smoothly. PUBG Mobile's image quality and details are relatively low, because it tries to match the configuration of the mobile phone. In the figure below, we can see the details of different Mobiles and PC versions.</p>

        <p>2. We don't need a very expensive mobile phone to run PUBG Mobile, because we can set the picture quality and fluency of the game in Setting according to the configuration of our mobile phone. We need to pay to buy a PC version on Steam, but since PUBG Mobile is a more “grass-roots” game, we can download it from Google Store without paying.</p>

        <p>In the PUBG PC version, when the enemy approached us, we could not see footprints and markers showing the direction of the enemy on the map. And PUBG PC players are basically more skilled, so winning is very competitive. However, in PUBG Mobile, we can   see the orientation mark on the map in the upper right corner. Moreover, in order to make new players feel more accomplished, PUBG Mobile has added some robots to the game for novice players to train their gun skills and courage. As the player's level rises,   the number of robots decreases until they disappear.</p>
